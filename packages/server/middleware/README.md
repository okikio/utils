`@okikio/server/middleware`
==========================

Import-safe middleware contracts, typed context definitions, direct runtime
handler bindings, deterministic placement plans, validation, and documentation.

The package does not own authentication providers, organization repositories,
framework applications, request validation, requirement-family policy, or
resource construction. Those concepts contribute their own definitions and are
composed by the server compiler.

Definitions and context
-----------------------

```ts
import * as middleware from '@okikio/server/middleware';

export const Authentication = middleware.context<{
  readonly actorId: string;
}>()({
  id: 'identity.authentication',
  description: 'Verified application authentication.',
});

export const Organization = middleware.context<{
  readonly organizationId: string;
}>()({
  id: 'identity.organization',
  description: 'Active organization.',
});

export const ResolveOrganization = middleware.define({
  id: 'identity.resolve-organization',
  description: 'Resolve the active organization.',
  requires: [Authentication],
  provides: [Organization],
  resources: [OrganizationRepository],
  problems: [OrganizationRequired],
});
```

Definitions are static data. Runtime behavior is supplied separately and bound
by direct identity:

```ts
export const ResolveOrganizationHandler = middleware.handler(
  ResolveOrganization,
  async (context, next) => {
    // Resolve and set the declared context value.
    return await next();
  },
);
```

Placement and ordering
----------------------

A plain middleware definition uses the normal `afterValidation` lane. Special
placement is explicit at the composition site:

```ts
middleware: [
  middleware.wholeRequest(RequestDiagnostics),
  middleware.beforeValidation(VerifyWebhookSignature),
  ResolveOrganization,
  middleware.aroundOperation(TransactionScope),
]
```

The lane names describe **what they surround**, not what the middleware itself does:

1. `wholeRequest` — surrounds every application stage from raw request guards
   through the declared handler result. It does not imply that a streamed body
   has finished reaching the client.
2. `beforeValidation` — runs after whole-request setup and before endpoint input
   parsing/Standard Schema validation. Use it for exact raw webhook signatures
   and other pre-parsing guards.
3. `afterValidation` — the default lane. It receives validated inputs and runs
   before generic requirement interpretation and the operation.
4. `aroundOperation` — the innermost lane immediately around the endpoint
   handler. Use it for transactions and units of work.

```text
incoming Request
│
├─ wholeRequest.before
│  │
│  ├─ beforeValidation.before
│  │  ├─ authentication
│  │  ├─ parse request locations
│  │  ├─ Standard Schema validation
│  │  │
│  │  └─ afterValidation.before        ← default lane
│  │     ├─ requirement families
│  │     │   permission / entitlement / meter / future families
│  │     │
│  │     └─ aroundOperation.before
│  │        └─ endpoint handler
│  │        aroundOperation.after
│  │     afterValidation.after
│  │  beforeValidation.after
│  wholeRequest.after
│
├─ verify declared result/problem
├─ materialize with the service request state
└─ response-completion observer
   body drained, cancelled, aborted, or errored
```

Authored order is preserved within each lane. Each lane uses normal onion
semantics, so post-`next()` work unwinds in reverse order. Response completion
is deliberately a separate host lifecycle because returning a streaming
response is not the same as finishing delivery.

Once-per-request handlers
-------------------------

When the same imported middleware definition is intentionally contributed at
several composition layers, wrap its runtime binding rather than storing state
in a framework context or module-global sets:

```ts
export const RequestMetricsHandler = middleware.once(
  middleware.handler(RequestMetrics, async (context, next) => {
    return await recordRequest(context, next);
  }),
);
```

The wrapper is keyed by the actual `Request` object and exact middleware
definition. Duplicate occurrences still call `next()`, while the wrapped inner
work runs once. A different request is never suppressed.

Validation and documentation
----------------------------

- `middleware.plan()` normalizes nested middleware input into deterministic
  lanes.
- `middleware.validate()` detects duplicate IDs, unavailable required context,
  and conflicting context providers before runtime creation.
- `middleware.middlewareCatalog()`, `select()`, and `compose()` provide reusable
  immutable collections without global registration.
- `middleware.document()` produces JSON-safe context, resource, problem,
  requirement and resiliency inventories.

Definitions snapshot nested contribution arrays, so later mutation of authoring
inputs cannot change a compiled graph.
